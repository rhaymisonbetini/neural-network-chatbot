CHATBOT NEURAL-NETWORK is an open source project developed with RNA aimed at automating chat processes in systems.<br/>

Every system runs on top of Google's powerful TensorFlow and the Adonis.js Framework (with node.js).<br/>

Without a database dependency, all brain models and files are stored in Binary.<br/>

# 1 HOW TO INSTALL

```
git clone
```
```
cd project-name
```
```
npm install
```

```
adonis serve --dev
```
Your chatbot will start at localhost on port 3333

# 2 HOW TO TRAIN YOUR CHATBOT

This is a very cool step in our system.
inside ```/app/Providers/Train.js /``` there is our Train class.<br/>
It has a method called returnDatas ().<br/>
This is our method that returns all questions with their answers so that our system does all the training.<br/>

An array of objects will be returned that should contain the phrase that our chat should learn and the possible answers that exist for that phrase.
<b>It is very important that each sentence had 5 and only 5 answer alternatives.<b/><br/>
```javascript
async returnDatas() {
        return [
            {
                Question: "Ol√°",
                Answer: {
                    Aliases: [
                        "Ei,tudo bem?",
                        "Ola,tudo bem?",
                        "Ei como vai voce?",
                        "Oi, tudo bem?",
                        "Que bom que voce veio, ola!",
                    ],
                },
            }
        ]
  }
```
